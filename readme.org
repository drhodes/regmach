* A graphical register machine simulator
** What?
- Of the ilk found in chapter 5 of SICP.

** Why?
- It would be neat to be able to mess around with an interactive
  version of the register machines.

** How?
- Would like to get a working build that uses opengl and rust
  cross-platform and on the browser with a non-trivial project.

** Details.
*** vector workflow with lyon and opengl
**** Inkscape 
- draw stuff in inkscape.
- select the target objects
- > Path > Combine
- > Path > Object to Path
- [F2] into node edit mode
- (toolbar) insert new nodes into selected segments
- (toolbar) make selected segments lines

**** Programming
- save the svg out to disk.  At this point, what you're looking for is
  the path string, and it can be found at the bottom of the saved svg.
- use lyon_svg to tesselate the path string (two lines of code).
