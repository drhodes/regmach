* A graphical register machine simulator
** What?
- Of the ilk found in chapter 5 of SICP.

** Why?
- It would be neat to be able to mess around with an interactive
  version of the register machines.

- Would like to get a working build that uses opengl and rust
  cross-platform and on the browser with a non-trivial project.
